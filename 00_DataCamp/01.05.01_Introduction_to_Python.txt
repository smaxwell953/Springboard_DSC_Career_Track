# Print the sum of 7 and 10
print(7+10)

---Any comments?---
# Division
print(5 / 8)

# Addition

---Variable Assignment---
# Create a variable savings

# Print out savings
print(savings)

---Calculations With Variables---
# Create a variable savings

# Calculate result
result = savings * growth_multiplier ** 7

# Print out result

---Other variable types---
# Create a variable desc
desc = "compound interest"

# Create a variable profitable
