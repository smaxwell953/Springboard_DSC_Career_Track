---INTRODUCING IMAGE PROCESSING AND SCIKIT-IMAGE---
---RGB to grayscale---
# Import the modules from skimage
from skimage import data, color

# Load the rocket image
rocket = data.rocket()

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray_scaled_rocket = color.rgb2gray(rocket)

# Show the original image
show_image(rocket, 'Original RGB image')

# Show the grayscale image
show_image(gray_scaled_rocket, 'Grayscale image')

---Flipping out---
# Flip the image vertically
seville_vertical_flip = np.flipud(flipped_seville)

# Flip the image horizontally
seville_horizontal_flip = np.fliplr(seville_vertical_flip)

# Show the resulting image
show_image(seville_horizontal_flip, 'Seville')

---Histograms---
# Obtain the red channel
red_channel = image[:, :, 0]

# Plot the red histogram with bins in a range of 256
plt.hist(red_channel.ravel(), bins=256)

# Set title and show
plt.title('Red Histogram')
plt.show()

---Apply global thresholding---
# Import the otsu threshold function
from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu

# Make the image grayscale using rgb2gray
chess_pieces_image_gray = rgb2gray(chess_pieces_image)

# Obtain the optimal threshold value with otsu
thresh = threshold_otsu(chess_pieces_image_gray)

# Apply thresholding to the image
binary = chess_pieces_image_gray > thresh

# Show the image
show_image(binary, 'Binary image')

---When the background isn't that obvious---
# Import the otsu threshold function
from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu

# Obtain the optimal otsu global thresh value
global_thresh = threshold_otsu(page_image)

# Obtain the binary image by applying global thresholding
binary_global = page_image > global_thresh

# Show the binary image obtained
show_image(binary_global, 'Global thresholding')

# Import the local threshold function
from skimage.filters import threshold_local

# Set the block size to 35
block_size = 35

# Obtain the optimal local thresholding
local_thresh = threshold_local(page_image, block_size, offset=10)

# Obtain the binary image by applying local thresholding
binary_local = page_image > local_thresh

# Show the binary image
show_image(binary_local, 'Local thresholding')

---Trying other methods---
# Import the try all function
from skimage.filters import try_all_threshold

# Import the rgb to gray convertor function 
from skimage.color import rgb2gray

# Turn the fruits_image to grayscale
grayscale = rgb2gray(fruits_image)

# Use the try all method on the resulting grayscale image
fig, ax = try_all_threshold(grayscale, verbose=False)

# Show the resulting plots
plt.show()

---Apply thresholding---
# Import threshold and gray convertor functions
from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu
from skimage.color import rgb2gray

# Turn the image grayscale
gray_tools_image = rgb2gray(tools_image)

# Obtain the optimal thresh
thresh = threshold_otsu(gray_tools_image)

# Obtain the binary image by applying thresholding
binary_image = gray_tools_image > thresh

# Show the resulting binary image
show_image(binary_image, 'Binarized image')
